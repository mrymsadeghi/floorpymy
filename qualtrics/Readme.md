This code reads floorplan evaluation data from a CSV file, associates the scores with corresponding floorplan images, and differentiates between human-generated and machine-generated plans.
It writes the results into another CSV file for further analysis and prints color-coded feedback based on whether the floorplans are machine-generated or human-generated.
It likely aims to compare how human-designed vs machine-generated floorplans score according to the data in the CSV file.
