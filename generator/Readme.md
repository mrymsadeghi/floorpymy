This code defines a **SimpleGenerator** class that generates a floorplan layout and places doors between rooms. Here’s what each part does:

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Initializes the generator with the dimensions of the lot and a list of desired room types.

2. **get_largest_room**: Returns the room with the largest area from a list of rooms.

3. **get_random_point_in_room**: Selects a random point inside a room based on a Gaussian distribution around the room’s center.

4. **get_nearest_value**: Finds the nearest available value for a point coordinate (either `x` or `y`) within a specified search radius, adjusting to avoid previously used values.

5. **generate_candidate_floorplan**: 
   - Begins with a single large room and subdivides it into smaller rooms until the desired number of rooms is reached.
   - Subdivision occurs at randomly chosen points inside the largest room.
   - Two door generation methods are called: `add_doors_depth_first` and `add_doors_minimum_spanning_tree`.

6. **add_doors_depth_first**: 
   - Adds doors between rooms using a depth-first traversal.
   - It starts with one room and explores its neighbors. It places doors based on area-to-perimeter ratios between rooms to control door placement direction.

7. **add_doors_minimum_spanning_tree**: 
   - Builds a minimum spanning tree of room connections, ensuring all rooms are accessible through a minimal number of doors.
   - Doors are placed on the edges between connected rooms in the tree.

In summary, this code generates floorplans by subdividing rooms and adding doors between them in two phases: first using depth-first traversal, and then refining door placements using a minimum spanning tree algorithm to ensure optimal connectivity.
